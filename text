- Ability to 'book' an appointment slot by specific Operator or any
- Ability to 'reschedule' or 'cancel' appointment
- Ability to show all booked appointments of an operator. This should display all individual
appointments ie. 1-2, 2-3, 3-4
- Ability to show open slots of appointments for an operator. This should merge all consecutive
open slots and show as 4-14 instead of 4-5, 5-6 .. 13-14.



- number of service operators can be hardcoded to 3 - ServiceOperator0, ServiceOperator1,
ServiceOperator2
- Please give an identifier to Appointment Id. This is crucial part of system which allows auditing
- Don't worry about the customer's aspect. Assume that you just have 1 customer who is
booking multiple appointments at the same time or at different times of day/week

- I am not concerned with dates as well. Solve the problem for a single day (but ensure your
solution can be expanded to work with say weekly schedule or yearly calendar)
- Don't worry about AM/PM. Use 24-hour format as it will greatly simplify your solution too.
